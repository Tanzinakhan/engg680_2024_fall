Brief summary of Assignment 1:
The primary focusÂ of this assignment is to create a functional grade management system, organize the repository, and collaborate efficiently using Github, prioritizing good documentation and version control practices. The first segment of the assignment emphasizes collaboration, code management, and repository structuring. The second part is the development of a Student Gradebook Management System that effectively computes and monitors student GPAs. However, this assignment helped us learn how to collaborate using GitHub and Google Colab while offering experience in remote teamwork.
